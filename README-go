This is a README for setting up and running the Scribble-Go tool.

Scribble is a toolchain for validating protocols based on multiparty session types, and generating APIs for implementing the endpoints.  Scribble-Go is a version of Scribble that supports API generation for the Go language.


Scribble-Go preliminaries
---

(1) Scribble

The version of Scribble needed for Scribble-Go is located here:

  https://github.com/rhu1/scribble-java/tree/rhu1-statetypegen

N.B. a different repository may be used in the future.

Instructions on building Scribble can be found here:

  https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~rhu/scribble/tutorial/#SCRIBBUILD

This will produce a zip inside the scribble-dist Maven project:

  dist/target/scribble-dist-0.4-SNAPSHOT.zip

Scribble is ready to run by simply extracting the contents of the zip.


(2) Scribble-Go: Go packages and tests

Additional Go packages needed to use Scribble-Go are located here:

  https://github.com/rhu1/scribble-go-test.git

The repository can be cloned using Git.

N.B. a different repository will be used in the future; the packages will also be renamed.


Setting up the Scribble-Go tool
---

This README assumes Go is installed.  The following instructions are just for example; other setups are possible.

(3) Add the scribble-go-test Git directory from (2) to the GOPATH environment variable.

(4) Extract the contents of the zip from (1) into the same directory.


Example tool usage
---

The following instructions assume the scribble-go-test Git directory is the current directory in a terminal.  The instructions are given for a Hello World Scribble example included in the scribble-go-test repository from (2):

  https://github.com/rhu1/scribble-go-test/blob/master/src/scrib/hello/Hello.scr

(5) Use the scribblec.sh script from (4) to generate Go APIs for implementing the endpoints of the Hello protocol:

  ./scribblec.sh -ip src -d src src/scrib/hello/Hello.scr -goapi
	Hello A -goapi Hello B

The arguments to the above command generate the APIs for both the A and B roles; these APIs can also be separately generated.

(6) [Standard Go usage]  Compile the example Go program implementing the Hello endpoints:

  go install scrib/hello

(7) [Standard Go usage]  Run the Hello program:

  bin/hello
